        </div>
         <ol class="section--desc">
           
           <li>
              <span>Installing and updating your anti-virus, anti-spyware software and firewall software</span>
              <p>Malicious software such as viruses, Trojan horses and worms are kept out of your computer by these. We recommend that you install these as soon as possible if your computer does not them.</p>
           </li>
           <p>Firewall prevents unauthorised access into your computer.</p>
           
           <li>
              <span>Update your computer operating system</span>
              <p>Update your computer’s Microsoft Windows or Macintosh OSX regularly. These updates include patches or fixes to security flaws. You can set the updating of your operating system to automatic to minimise the chances that your computer is exposed to security flaws.</p>
           </li>

           <li>
             <span>Supported operating system</span>
            <p>It is important to update your operating system to one that is supported by the vendor. Certain old systems such as Microsoft Windows 98 and 2000 for example are no longer supported.</p>
          </li>           
          
           <li>
             <span>Update your web browsers</span>
             <p>Make sure your web browsers are updated to the latest version and enable is security functions. You can normally find this option under the browser’s security settings page.</p>
           </li>           

           <li>
             <span>Account passwords and 2 Factor Authentication</span>
             <p>Set a strong password for any user account you have created. A good guide to a strong password would be minimally of 8 characters in length, consisting of upper and lower alphabets, numbers and symbols. Your user account details must be kept confidential.</p>
           </li>
           <p>Always enable 2-Factor Authentication if the site allows you to do so. This adds an extra layer of security to your account.</p>

           <li>
             <span>Limiting the rights accounts for user</span>
             <p>If the computer is being shared, rights accounts for user should be limited to only daily tasks such as checking emails or browsing the web. This can reduce the effectiveness of many types of malware.</p>
            </li>           

           <li>
             <span>Stop and think before opening attachments</span>
             <p>Do not click on unknown attachments. Many malware authors rely on links and email attachments to transmit viruses, worms and Trojan horses on computers. Even if the attachment is sent from a friend, be sceptical as your friend’s computer could have been compromised by malware.</p>
            </li>           

           <li>
             <span>Log out, clear your browser cache and turning off your computer</span>
             <p>Always remember to clear your browser cache and log out form your internet session especially if you were using a shared computer.</p>
           </li>           
           <p>Always turn off your computer when not in use. An idle computer with an active internet connection is at a higher chance of being attacked by a cybercriminal.</p>
           
           <li>
             <span>Back up your information</span>
             <p>Always create a back-up of your computer information on external storage space regularly. This ensures you always have access to your data when your computer is compromised.</p>
           </li>           

           <li>
             <span>https://</span>
             <p>Ensure that the website where you are transmitting sensitive personal and financial information is secure. You can click on the padlock icon beside the web address to view the digital certificate information.</p>
