<img src="/assets/articles/images/23/thumbnail.jpg" class="pull-right thumbnail" style=" padding:10px;"  alt="Answers to Singaporeans' top 5 questions on insurance">
<p>I feel a large sense  of injustice when I hear my peers paying large sums of money for their  insurance plans and yet, they do not have the essential insurance coverage they  need. It could be disastrous for them if they meet a crisis. </p>
<br/>
<p>Have you been  introduced to insurance by a family member, a friend or a stranger on the  streets? While we faintly know that having insurance is essential, it is  difficult to fully understand and get an independent opinion on insurance.</p>
<br/>
<p>I want to help as many  Singaporeans as possible plan for their insurance needs the right way and hope  that this article will point you in the right direction by providing  easy-to-understand answers on some of the questions which you may have about  insurance. </p>
<br/>
<p>This could also act as  a good guide for you to go about planning for your own insurance needs. </p>

<ol>
  	<li>  
  		<h4 class="primary-color"><strong>Why  do I need insurance? </strong></h4>	
  		<p>The primary purpose of  insurance is to protect ourselves from financial risk. If an unexpected event  happens, insurance helps us to reduce the financial impact of an unexpected  event on our loved ones and ourselves.</p>
		<br>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4 class="primary-color"><strong>Who  should I seek insurance advice from? </strong></h4>
		<p>Do you know that 41%  of Singaporeans have not managed to start saving for <a href="http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/life-events/retirement.aspx" target="_blank">retirement</a> in a survey conducted  in 2013? For every dollar more we spend on insurance, it makes our retirement much  more difficult.</p>
		<p>You should preferably seek advice from an advisor whose livelihood does not  depend on the commissions he earns from you. A true independent advisor will be  able to compare products across insurance companies and advise you according to  your needs. Do note that there is no insurance company which has the best plans  for all the types of insurance products you need.</p>
		<br>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4 class="primary-color"><strong>Which  type of insurance do I need? And how much should I spend on insurance?</strong></h4>
		<p>As little as possible  for what is necessary to protect yourself and your loved ones from financial  risk. Channel every other dollar to your savings and long-term investments to  plan for your retirement.</p>

  		<h4 class="primary-color"><strong>Should  I get a Term Life Insurance or a Whole Life Plan?</strong></h4>
        <p>There is no need for a  Whole Life Insurance Plan. If you get a Whole Life Insurance Plan, it is very  difficult to fulfill both of your insurance needs and <a href="http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/life-events/retirement.aspx" target="_blank">retirement</a> needs.</p>
