<p>Now is  the best time to save more and pay less tax.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.mof.gov.sg/MOF-For/Individuals/Supplementary-Retirement-Scheme-SRS" target="_blank" title="Supplementary Retirement Scheme">Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS)</a> was started in 2001 and the scheme has been getting popular. When you contribute to your SRS account, you enjoy the same dollar amount which you have contributed in tax relief for your following year&rsquo;s income tax assessment. Thus, the higher your income tax rate is, the bigger your incentive. </p>
<p>The government encourages us to keep our SRS savings for our old age. When you withdraw your SRS savings at age 62 or later, only 50% of the amount withdrawn for the year will be assessed in the following year's tax computation. By spreading your SRS withdrawals over a period of up to 10 years, you can minimise or you may not even need to pay any tax on your SRS.</p>
<p>The maximum SRS you can contribute currently $12,750 per year.&nbsp;If your  marginal tax bracket is at 11.5% (i.e. chargeable income from $80,000 to  $120,000) and you contribute $12,750 to SRS this year, you can enjoy <strong>$1,466</strong> in tax savings next year!&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have only about one month till the end of the year to contribute to your SRS for this year if you have not already done so that you can enjoy tax relief next year!</p>
<br>
<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>What can  you do with your SRS savings?</strong></h3>
<p>You can  invest in a wide range of financial instruments including shares, unit trust,  insurance, bonds and fixed deposits. The other alternative is to leave your SRS  monies in cash, which does not make much financial sense because of the current  low interest rate environment. It is surprising that as at 2014, one third of all  SRS monies are left in cash!</p>
<p>These are  the <strong>3 types of SRS-approved insurance policies</strong> you can consider to meet  your retirement income objectives.</p>
<br>
<h3 class="primary-color">1. Retirement Income stream with  Guaranteed Amount for limited years</h3>
<p>This type  of product is designed to pay an income stream starting from a specified age in  the future and paid out over a limited number of years (e.g., 10/15/20 years).  On the final payout, an additional maturity benefit may be payable to us. The  unique feature of this type of product is that the regular income payout amount  is fully guaranteed. Hence this is good for those who are risk adverse but yet  desire a good return on their <a href="http://www.mof.gov.sg/MOF-For/Individuals/Supplementary-Retirement-Scheme-SRS" target="_blank" title="Supplementary Retirement Scheme">SRS</a> money.</p>

<h3 class="primary-color">2. Retirement Income stream with  Variable Amount for limited years</h3>
<p>The  difference with this product as compared to the first, is that instead of a full  guaranteed payment amount that is paid out to you, the payout amount which you  receive is only partially guaranteed. If you have chosen this product and have  decided to bear with some risks (uncertainty) in your payout, you could  potentially receive a higher payout as compared to the first type of product. This  product type is suitable for those who are prepared to bear with some  fluctuations in exchange for a higher potential payout.</p>

<h3 class="primary-color">3. Retirement Income with Increasing  Amount for life</h3>
<p>This product  type is quite different from the earlier first two. The income portion for this  type of product is payable for as long as you live. If you think you might live  up to a ripe old age, this product is a good consideration. Another good  product feature is that the amount of income payout has the potential to  increase! Whenever the insurer declares a bonus, the income amount will  increase to a higher level and the income amount would be guaranteed from  thereon. In this way, this policy not only pays for life, the amount can  increase to offset inflation. </p>

<p>Whilst it  is good to contribute into SRS to build up your retirement nest egg, you should  also optimise your SRS savings by investing appropriately to grow your nest egg  bigger and achieve your retirement objectives. There are other rules on SRS such as treatment for early death, migration and bankruptcy which you may find out more from the <a href="http://www.mof.gov.sg/MOF-For/Individuals/Supplementary-Retirement-Scheme-SRS" target="_blank" title="Supplementary Retirement Scheme">Ministry of Finance SRS webpage.</a></p>
<p>The above  examples are for illustration purposes only. Policy projections are  non-guaranteed and actual figures are dependent on the performance of their  life funds.</p>
