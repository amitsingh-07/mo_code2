<p>After many years of formal schooling  and being out of school, like all young working adults, I was eager to excel in  the career that I had embarked on. <br>
<br>All of us would remember  the time when we received our first pay cheque from our first full-time job. It  was a sweet reward which we achieved all through our own effort. It  was a significant moment and many of us would have celebrated this occasion by  giving treats to our loved ones and friends.<br>
<br>Not fully realising, I have  made the first step up to the next life-stage. And it is a time that I am going  have the power to manage the most money I have come into touch with than ever  before. </p><br>
  
<h3 class="primary-color"><strong><em>With great power, comes  great responsibility. </em></strong></h3><br>
<p>With my parents laboring in the work force  for decades, I begin to see the lines on their worn-out skin. I start noticing  that there is now more hair left behind in the bathroom. The volume of their voices  have also softened and they speak with a little less gusto than before<br>
<br><em>My parents are aging. </em><br>
<br>It is a time when we now want to  reduce the burden on our parents and we initiate to take over our own personal  expenses and contribute towards our monthly expenses. <br>
<br>And almost unknowingly, our material  needs have increased. With more money in hand, we begin to eat a little better,  wear a little better and buy a little more. The phase of a young working adult  is also when many of us begin to make plans for our future with a life partner.  Still at a young age, we need to make our biggest financial commitments and  decisions on our housing and marriage needs.<br>
<br>Our financial responsibility skyrockets. </p><br>

<h3 class="primary-color"><strong><em>What if?</em></strong></h3><br>
<p>With these responsibilities, there  is little room for error. I need to look out for any events which could occur  that would prevent me from fulfilling my financial responsibility.<br>
<br><strong>Getting fired:</strong> If I were to  get fired, would I be able to replace this income? While this is going to be a stressful period, it is likely that I would be able to find an alternative job  if I am not too choosy as I am still relatively young. This is less of a financial risk. <br>
<br><strong>Falling critically ill and unfortunate demise: </strong>With little savings, would I be able to pay for my medical  expenses and how can I replace my lost income? How can my parents and my loved  ones not be financially impacted if I am no longer around to provide for them? <br>
<br>As a young working adult, we have  little savings to start off with and we would not be able to provide for ourselves  or our loved ones financially in the event we fall critically ill or pass away.  Rather than taking on this financial risk ourselves, it is important for us to  transfer this financial risk to a third party and this is where insurance comes  to play. </p><br>

<h3 class="primary-color"><strong><em>The headache</em></strong></h3><br>
<p>More often than not, most of us had  an early and forced introduction to insurance. We were either approached by a  relative, a friend or stopped by a stranger at a public place to complete a  survey. For most of us, it is likely that we made our first insurance policy  purchase through one of these channels. <br>
<br>While it is with positive intentions  when they were introduced to us, we probably had little knowledge that the cost  for similar types of insurance products across insurance companies can be very  different. It is also essential that we  understand the amount of insurance coverage we require for the right areas. <br>
<br>We do not want to be paying and  still not be insured with enough insurance coverage, especially in areas of high  priorities. For example, whole life insurance and accident insurance are not  top priorities for young working adults.</p><br>

<h3 class="primary-color"><strong><em>Protecting our loved  ones and ourselves</em></strong></h3><br>
<br>As we strive towards our goals, it is important that we are  aware of our financial responsibilities. It is essential that we understand how  we could transfer these financial risks away to protect our loved ones and  ourselves from the heavy financial impact of any unexpected event.</p>
