                <p>Endowment policies are designed to help you save for the future. You contribute a regular premium for a number of years and at the end of the policy duration you receive a lump sum Maturity payout. Some Endowment policies have a Cash Back feature, whereby Yearly Cash Benefits are given at specified years in addition to the Maturity payout.</p>
				<p>The rate of return from Endowment policies typically ranges around 2.0% to 4.0% p.a., depending on the type of Endowment policy, entry age and policy duration.</p>

In return, you are given a stream of income, known as Yearly Cash Benefits, at specified intervals, and a lump sum Maturity payout at the end of the policy term. If you do not wish to withdraw any of these Yearly Cash Benefits, they can be deposited with the insurer to earn an interest, usually higher than what banks would pay.</p>
