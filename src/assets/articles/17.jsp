<div class="text-center"><img src="/assets/articles/images/compare_dpi.jpg" class="pull-right thumbnail" style=" padding:10px;" alt="Singapore's First Life Insurance Comparison Web Portal"></div>
<p>Under the Financial Advisory Industry Review (FAIR) by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the MAS has launched initiatives to create a more competitive market for insurance products and empower consumers to make informed decisions through better access to information.</p>
<p>The launch of web aggregators allows consumers to compare the premiums and features of life insurance products. Comparison platforms are set to revolutionise the insurance industry in Singapore with web aggregators already popular in the United Kingdom and Australia.</p>
<p>We share with you how our Web Portal can help you plan, compare and save on your life insurance needs. With the introduction of <a href="http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/understanding-financial-products/insurance/types-of-insurance/life-insurance/types-of-life-insurance/direct-purchase-insurance.aspx" target="_blank" title="Direct Purchase Insurance">Direct Purchase Insurance (DPI)</a>, it is important for you to understand and consider critical and important differences before purchasing DPI with this article.</p>

<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>1.	Comparing a Wide Variety of Products</strong></h3>
<!-- <div class="text-center"><img src="../assets/images/filterbox.png" alt="Comparing a wide variety of products"></div>
<br><br> -->

<p>On top of term life and whole life plans, we compare stand-alone Critical Illness, Disability Income, Long Term Care and Annuities for retirement income. The wide variety of products available on the comparison web portal means you are able to find the product which best suits your needs.  You can purchase your insurance needs from this one-stop shop with us. </p>
<br><br>
<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>2. Premium Savings</strong></h3>
<br><p><strong>50% Commission Rebates* and Promotions</strong></p>
<p>In addition to ongoing promotions which could significantly reduce your cost, MoneyOwl provides 50% commission rebates* back to all consumers in cash when you purchase any product through us and that means greater cost savings to you.</p>
<br><p><strong>No limits to amount of Insurance Coverage</strong></p>
<p>A person will easily need $700,000 to more than $1million of life insurance coverage. An illustration of a life insurance calculation can be found in <a href=" https://www.moneyowl.com.sg/articles/entry/16">this article</a>. This is to sufficiently provide for our dependents' livelihood on our unfortunate demise. Not having sufficient coverage means our dependents may have trouble paying off our housing loan, education fees and to maintain their lifestyle without an income.</p>
